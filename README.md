### Known Bugs/ToDos

   + Changing size of font does not work during the actual practice typing session. We should 
   have the size setting in the pasting of the reference text influence the practice text size.
   + Changing the font erases the typing input box if it is change while typing. It should leave
   you where you are and just change the font.
